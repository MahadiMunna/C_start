# \n for new line
# // for single line comment and /* for multiline comment.
# \t for tab that means 4space\
# Format specifier:
    int - %d
    float - %f
    char - %c
# Variable declare:
    dataType variableName;
# Variable take memory in RAM/temporary memory.
# Int type date take 4byte
# 1kb = 1024byte
# To declare decimal point limit use %0.2f. Here 2 for 2 decimal point.

#To take input from user use scanf("") function.example:
    scanf("%d",&number);
    here, %d for formate specifier and & for addressing memory location of that variable.
# 1bit = 0 / 1
    1byte = 8bit;
# int limitation 4byte that means 32bit.(-10 power 9 to +10 power 9)
# long long int 8byte that means 64 bit(-10 power 18 to +10 power 18). Format specifier %lld
#float can print upto 4 decimal point, to make it more use double which formate specifier is %lf.
#double can give correct value upto 16digt.

#varibale naming convention:
1. must start with letter or _(underscore).
2. can contain only letter, digit or underscore.
